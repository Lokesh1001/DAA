/*
Small Large Split Merge sort is a variation of standard merge sort, where the 'n' (if n>2) elements in the sequence are split into two parts with 2 elements in the first part and (n-2) elements in the second part. If n==2, then split them into two equal sorted sequences. Given the partial code of standard merge sort in the code editor, modify the code such that Small Large Split Merge Sort is implemented. There is no change in the merge function, here we merge function similar to the standard merge sort.
1. Analyse the time complexity of this variant of merge sort and make a note in the algorithm part

2. Run the code (in your laptop) for different input sizes like 100, 200, ....,  and plot a graph for the time taken by the algorithm

Input Format

First line contains the number of elements to be sorted, n

Next line contains the 'n' elements to be sorted which are separated by space

Output Format

Print the elements in ascending order
